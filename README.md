Chrome extension to mitigate on-screen movement.

Have you ever experienced increased eye strain, headaches, distractibility, and or frustration after surfing the web? If so, give Ebb a try! 

Ebb is a free Chrome extension that reduces the appearance of moving site components, like GIFs and CSS animations, which can be a common trigger for people with various neurological and sensory conditions, like ADHD, photophobia, chronic fatigue, migraines. Thus, by minimizing on-screen movements, Ebb can help people like you have safer and less painful online experiences, making web browsing more inclusive and accessible.

Ebb is designed with accessibility in-mind with elements like a simplistic user experience, a dark and soothing color scheme, keyboard navigation and focus, and OS-based shortcuts. Weâ€™re always working to make Ebb better, so we built a feedback tool right into the extension. 

So, do you want to browse more comfortably? Try surfing the web with Ebb!
